# Seymour

Seymour is a Discord bot forked from my previous bot, [Bean the Corgi](https://github.com/sydneyq/Bean-the-Corgi).

This is a bot personalized for the Discord servers that I staff. 

## Features

Some features are disabled for the purposes of our servers, but they're functional.

* Code-word and confirmation verification.
* Customized welcoming after verification.
* Occasional high-five events to engage members.
* Action commands.
* Enable and disable Cogs.
* Currency and badges.
* Profiles. 
* Matchmaking system.
* Sending and editing mod-sent messages.
