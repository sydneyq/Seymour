# Seymour

Seymour is a Discord bot forked from Bean the Corgi.

The original description for Bean can be found below. 

## Bean the Corgi

Bean the Corgi is a bot made with Python 3.7 and the discord.py wrapper.

This bot was made specifically for the Mind Caf√© server, which aims to be a mental health support space.

## Testing

Because this bot was made for a specific server and functionality in mind, you may have to swap some IDs around for personal testing.

Create your own file named `secret.py`; this should hold the hardcoded keys and IDs.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome for those who understand the already-existing code. Please be sure to thoroughly explain your changes.

## Special Thanks
